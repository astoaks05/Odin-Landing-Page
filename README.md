# Odin-Landing-Page
My take on the Odin Project landing page assignment

At first the html was super easy. I knew what elements to use

and whatnot. When I arrived at the css styling portion of the 

project, I started having some issues. I thought I had a firm

grasp on flexbox but it turns out it is more complicated 

than I previously thought. At the end thought, I got something 

that sort of resembles the final picture, and now I would 

like to work on the dynamic design of the site.

Another note is that in the future, I need to specify the height

and flex direction of the body before anything else.
